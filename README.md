## About me

So, to be honest it was my dream to be a Diabetic nurse when I grew up. For me growing up with diabetes I always wanted children with diabetes to come to the hospital and get a nurse that really understand what it feels like. Obviously, it did not turn out that way. After working over one year in a grocery store and then a year as a waiter while trying to find my calling in life I went on sick leave. It was then I bought my first digital drawing board and started my interest in work I could to on the pc. After a shit day at work as a waiter I took a spontaneous shot and applied at Noroff front end. The next day I got the accepting letter, and I quit my job. This was almost two years ago now and the best decision in my life. Today I have my homebase in Vietnam with my boyfriend while we travel the world. And I promise you, studying is so much easier in 30 degrees and with some of the best views in the world. I have learned a lot the last few years, and I highly appreciate my time at Noroff.
